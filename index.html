            <p>Hello, my name is Sarolta. On this webpage, I would like to talk a little bit about some of my hobbies and why I love them. 
                These hobbies include art, both digital and traditional, hiking, and reading. 
                Each of them brings something special to my life:</p>

                    <a href="digital-and-traditional-art.html"><u>Art:</u></a> I love art because it grounds me in the present, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the creative process. 
                    Experimenting with colors, shapes, and techniques is a joy, and I truly enjoy the most when I reach that "flow" stateâ€”a moment of complete focus where everything around me fades away. 
                    A few years ago, I completed a short graphic design course, which led me to fall in love with digital art. I love how digital art offers the freedom to experiment without the worry of ruining a piece. 
                    Recently, I've been working more with traditional mediums, like acrylics, watercolors, and alcoholic markers. 
                    To me, art is a journey where the goal isn't to reach a certain level of skill, but rather to enjoy and embrace the path itself.

                    <a href="hiking.html"><u>Hiking:</u></a> Hiking is one of my favorite pastimes. I love being in nature: the silence, the peace. 
                    Hiking has been shown to be beneficial not only for our physical well-being but also for our mental health. 
                    Studies have proven that hiking can reduce anxiety, help with depression, and lift our overall mood.

                <li class="pt-5">
                    <a href="reading.html"><u>Reading:</u></a> I love reading because it lets me escape into different worlds and get lost in stories that spark my imagination. 
                    Through books, I can experience other lives, explore new perspectives, and learn things I might never encounter in real life. 
                    Whether it's a quiet moment of comfort or an exciting adventure, reading always gives me something to hold onto.
